### Our Vision

How can we create a sustainable city?

This is one of the biggest challenges that our society is facing today and honestly, there's no correct answer to it.

At **seedHUB** we believe that people hold an amazing power and that they are the main driving force that could reshape our cities. 
Indeed, **what would a city be without people?**

### Our strategy

Our goal is to spread knowledge and bring people together to build vibrant sustainable communities. 
**Together we can reshape our cities.**

We want to create **Sustainability Hubs** in every neighborhood of a city, adapting them to the needs of each community and engaging the citizens to be an active part of it.

### What is a Sustainability Hub?

**A Sustainability Hub is a place where sustainable communities are created.** 
**A Sustainability Hub is the starting point of change.**

It is a place where people learn how to become more sustainable and where they create a resilient community.

### What can you do in a Sustainability Hub?

- You can attend `workshops` lead by professionals. 
Here's a list of possible themes of these workshops: *"Installing a solar panel"*, *"Creating an energy community"*, *"Giving a second life to your clothes"*
- You can grow your own food and share it with your community. Every Sustainable Hub has a space reserved for `urban farming` solutions!
- You can leave items that you don't use anymore and other people can give them a `second life`.
- You can use its `shared spaces`, such as libraries, kitchens, and gaming areas.
- You can receive help from experts that work as a consultants to promote sustainability. With their help growing your own food or sewing your old clothes will be extremely easy!
- You can directly contribute to the development of your community.

But most importantly, a Sustainability Hub is a third home, a place where you feel comfortable and safe.


### Together we can rethink our cities.

## More sustainable cities, a better life.
