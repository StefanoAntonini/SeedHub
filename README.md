# Seed HUB
## Cultivating sustainable communities

### Our Vision

How can we create a sustainable city?

This is one of the biggest challenges that our society is facing today and honestly, there's no correct answer to it.

At **Seed HUB** we believe that people hold an amazing power and that they are the main driving force that could reshape our cities. 
Indeed, **what would a city be without people?**

### Our strategy

Our goal is to spread knowledge and bring people together to build vibrant sustainable communities. 
**Together we can reshape our cities.**

We want to create **Sustainability Hubs** in every neighborhood of a city, adapting them to the needs of each community and engaging the citizens to be an active part of it.

### What is a Sustainability Hub

**A Sustainability Hub is a place where sustainable communities are created.** 
**A Sustainability Hub is the starting point of change.**

It is a place where people learn how to become more sustainable and where they create a resilient community.

### What can you do in a Sustainability Hub?

Here's a list of possible themes of these workshops: *Installing a solar panel*, *Creating an energy community*, *Giving a second life to our clothes*
